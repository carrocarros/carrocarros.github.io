General directory for future websites! 

Hey, it's Frank. 
This whole project is an attempt to see if I'm able to create at least one website by myself.
I'll be tracking my progress here.
Let's see how this goes!
Yes, I had this private initially, but to use Git Pages you need the repo to be public lol.

Yours truly,
Frank
