General directory for future websites! 

Hey, it's Frank. 
This whole project is an attempt to see if I'm able to create at least one website by myself.
I'll be tracking my progress here.
This is private for now, but if it ends up working, I'll make this public (so the website can actually air...)
Let's see how this goes!

Yours truly,
Frank
